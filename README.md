# MeBot: A Chatbot That Knows You

MeBot is a personalized chatbot that answers questions about your experiences based on your resume. It uses text extracted from a PDF file of your resume as its context and communicates with a hypothetical AI model named Phi-3 for generating responses.

## Features
- Extracts text from your resume (PDF format) using the PdfPig library.
- Integrates with a hypothetical AI model (Phi-3) for natural language understanding and response generation.
- Enables interactive conversations about your professional experiences.
- Allows users to terminate the conversation gracefully by typing `/bye`.

## Prerequisites

- **.NET SDK**: Version 6.0 or higher.
- **NuGet Packages**:
  - [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json): For JSON serialization and deserialization.
  - [UglyToad.PdfPig](https://www.nuget.org/packages/UglyToad.PdfPig): For extracting text from PDFs.
- **Phi-3 API Key**: Replace `your-phi3-api-key` in the code with your actual API key.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/mebot.git

    ```

2. Install the required NuGet packages:
    ```bash
    dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
    dotnet add package UglyToad.PdfPig
    ```

3. Update the following constants in `Program.cs`:

## Code Overview

### `Program.cs`
- Entry point of the application.
- Handles user input and integrates with the Phi-3 API for response generation.

### `Helpers/PdfTextExtractor.cs`
- Extracts text from PDF files using the **PdfPig** library.
- Returns extracted text as a string.

### Phi-3 API Integration
- Sends user queries and the extracted resume text to the Phi-3 API.
- Receives and displays responses generated by the AI model.

## Limitations

1. **PDF Text Extraction**:
   - Works only with PDFs containing selectable text. For scanned/image-based PDFs, consider integrating OCR (e.g., Tesseract).

2. **Phi-3 Model**:
   - This implementation assumes a hypothetical AI API. Replace with a real AI model or service as needed.
